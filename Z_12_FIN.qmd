# Finland {#sec-country-fin .unnumbered}

:::{.lead}
Finland is ranked 4th overall on the Index and achieves the top position for
policy making.
:::

```{r, country-chart}
country_plot <- country_summary(incise2019_long, "FIN")
render_svg(
  country_plot, width = 700, height = 600,
  alt_text = "Summary chart of Finland's scores in the 2019 InCiSE index."
)
```

Finland achieves the maximum score for two policy making metrics which assess
strategic planning and coordination themes, plus one more on the quality of
policy advice. This suggests a strong all-round capability for this indicator.

Finland's other strongest scores are for crisis and risk management (ranked
3rd) where it achieves the maximum score for all but 2 metrics, openness
(ranked 4th) and capabilities(ranked 5th).

Within the openness indicator, Finland's metric scores are very high on access
to official information, the publication of laws, and the degree of government
consultation with citizens on policy issues.

Finland's capabilities results are noteworthy for its high scores for the
readiness to learn and degree of job-related learning metrics, suggesting a
strong learning and development ethos relative to other countries.
