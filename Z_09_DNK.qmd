# Denmark {#sec-country-dnk .unnumbered}

:::{.lead}
Denmark is ranked 6th overall on the Index and achieves very high scores for
many indicators.
:::

```{r, country-chart}
country_plot <- country_summary(incise2019_long, "DNK")
render_svg(
  country_plot, width = 700, height = 600,
  alt_text = "Summary chart of Denmark's scores in the 2019 InCiSE index."
)
```

Denmark is ranked 2nd for four indicators â€“ policy making, procurement,
openness and digital services. It is ranked 3rd for integrity and capabilities.
Within the policy making indicator, Denmark achieves the maximum score for the
metrics assessing strategic planning, the extent to which academic advice
influences policy decisions, and policy monitoring issues.

On openness, Denmark performs very strongly across the theme assessing the
degree of consultation with society on policy issues, including achieving
maximum scores for two out of three metrics. Denmark achieves the maximum score
for six of the digital services metrics, suggesting a strong investment in this
core function.

The main indicators where Denmark's scores are less strong relative to other
countries are crisis and risk management and inclusiveness. Both overall scores
are below average and metric scores vary widely.
