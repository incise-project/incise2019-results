# United States of America {#sec-country-usa .unnumbered}

:::{.lead}
The USA is ranked 11th overall on the Index. It performs very strongly on
capabilities (ranked 2nd) and crisis and risk management (ranked 4th).
:::

```{r, country-chart}
country_plot <- country_summary(incise2019_long, "AUS", c("CAP", "DIG"))
render_svg(
  country_plot, width = 700, height = 600,
  alt_text = "Summary chart of Australia's scores in the 2019 InCiSE index."
)
```

Within the capabilities indicator, almost all the USA's metric scores are
above average. It achieves very high scores for the metrics assessing
influencing skills and readiness to learn.

The USA also does well on all crisis and risk management metrics and achieves
the maximum score for half of them. The USA's maximum score for the
effectiveness of public spending within the fiscal and financial management
indicator is noteworthy.

The main area where the USA's performance is less strong relative to other
countries is policy making, where scores vary widely. It achieves the maximum
score for one of the policy coordination metrics but does less well on the
policy monitoring theme.
