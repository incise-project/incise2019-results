## Looking ahead {#sec-looking-ahead}

The overriding priority is to secure long-term funding to enable the InCiSE
project to be sustained, strengthened and expanded further. The founding
institutions are actively discussing funding, as well as broader management
and collaboration opportunities, with potential new partners. Subject to
funding availability, the main issues the project will focus on during the
next phase are described below.

### Expanding country coverage

InCiSE will continue to explore ways of expanding
the Index’s current country coverage, especially the potential to include
non-OECD and developing countries. During 2018 the partners commissioned
assessments of how the InCiSE Index could be applied in Brazil and Nigeria[^1].
These two countries were chosen as large, regionally significant states at
different stages of economic development and with diverse political structures
and traditions.

The studies yielded important questions to consider as the project moves
forward, such as: how well does the Index cope with countries with more
distributed power and less influential executive branches of government? Are
public service outcomes more important proxies for civil service effectiveness
in developing countries? Does the Index assume a particular model of
government, and if so, how does it capture the characteristics of systems that
do not fit this model? In addition, the studies highlighted the possibility of
considering the development of regional InCiSE indices, where there are data
sets that cover particular regions only.

Developing InCiSE as a practical learning and development tool InCiSE has major
potential as a learning and development tool. Even in its pilot form InCiSE data
has already been used by some governments for this purpose and there is much
interest in how it could be further developed.

The InCiSE Index appears to be of most use for the top leadership of the civil
service, senior officials tasked with driving systemic and behavioural reforms,
and relevant training and research institutes. Officials with more specific
responsibilities require data that speaks more directly to their functions and
interests. To help make InCiSE data more accessible and relevant for users, it
needs to be tailored more closely than has been possible to date. Experience so
far also suggests that users want to be able to dig more deeply into what is
driving the results, and then use this analysis to support learning
discussions. More broadly, experience suggests that data-based approaches
will only work when combined with other insights into country specific problems
and solutions.

The project will therefore focus on two inter-related sets of activity:

* Making InCiSE data more “customisable” for users, to allow them to dig
  deeper into country results and make more meaningful comparisons with others.
  This will be achieved by improving the interactivity of Index data on the
  Blavatnik School of Government website to enable users to tailor it for their
  needs, including generating reports. Over time, the goal is to establish a
  self-standing website;
* Enabling users to have easy access to InCiSE data experts who can help them
  deal with initial questions and guide early discussions on performance
  improvements. This will be achieved initially through the delivery of
  facilitated workshops in target countries and regions, ideally using local
  suppliers. Where feasible, these workshops could be held at the same time
  and location as major international public administration events.

### Continuing to strengthen data collection

Tasks will include: determining how best to collect data on the omitted
indicators (staff engagement, innovation, IT, social security administration
and finance); exploring how data collection for existing indicators can be
further strengthened, including filling thematic gaps; reviewing the balance
between quantitative and qualitative indicators; further expanding data
sources; reducing instances of public sector performance being used as a
proxy for civil service performance; and minimising cross-country
applicability issues.

### Refining the InCiSE framework

Framework tasks will include ensuring each indicator in the framework is a
unique concept, to avoid duplication or overlap between the themes being
measured. There is still a need to consider whether the InCiSE framework is
sufficiently able to measure and compare core functions within federal
government systems where some aspects could be the constitutional
responsibilities of sub-national entities (e.g. a state or provincial
government).

Changes to the InCiSE framework will be determined mainly through user
feedback and discussions with data owners to learn lessons from their own
experiences. The International Advisory Panel will also be consulted.

## Conclusion {#sec-conclusion}

This second version of the InCiSE Index has again brought together a rich
volume of data and insights. It should also continue to stimulate wide-ranging
discussions at country level and globally about civil service
effectiveness issues.

Producing a comprehensive and robust set of comparative civil service
performance indicators remains a work in progress. The InCiSE project team
will continue to coordinate with others who are engaged in similar efforts to
assess civil service effectiveness. The team will also continue to collaborate
with the many organisations who have made a vital contribution to InCiSE so
far by permitting the use of their research or survey data, as well as
encourage further data collection in areas where it is lacking. Continued
collaboration is essential to help strengthen InCiSE.

Feedback remains vitally important to help improve the Index. The project team
would welcome feedback from country governments, policy and learning networks,
think tanks and academia.
