    "text": "We are delighted to publish a second version of the International Civil Service Effectiveness (InCiSE) Index. This new version of InCiSE builds on the lessons learned during the pilot phase in 2017. It has also been informed by the very helpful feedback we received from colleagues all around the world. Thanks to their feedback and ideas, the 2019 Index covers 7 additional countries – taking the total to 38 – and the InCiSE model uses 46 more metrics and 5 more data sources than previously.\nThe core objective of the InCiSE Index remains the same: to help countries determine how their central civil services are performing and learn from each other.\nSince the July 2017 launch, we have been busy. The Blavatnik School of Government at the University of Oxford hosted a major international conference to discuss the pilot results and next steps. There was huge interest in the InCiSE project and the overwhelming view was that it should continue. The InCiSE framework was judged as having significant potential, especially as a learning and performance improvement tool, Conference participants from less developed countries were keen to engage with InCiSE despite their non-inclusion in the Index so far, and we are continuing to explore ways of achieving this.\nDuring 2018 we gave presentations on InCiSE at other international meetings, including at the OECD in Paris, a UNDP leadership training event in Singapore, and in Brussels at an event organised by the Hertie School of Governance. The report was additionally translated into Spanish by the Instituto de Administración Pública del Estado de Quintana Roo in Mexico, to be used at a major conference there. We also completed two in-depth country case studies – in Nigeria and Brazil – to determine the relevance of InCiSE in contexts where obtaining good quality data is more challenging.\nThe InCiSE Index was originally developed in consultation with a wide range of experts, We are grateful to all those who have given their time to help shape this second version. We are also grateful to the many organisations who have allowed us to use their data, some for the first time. It remains our goal to continue refining and expanding InCiSE, and to publish the Index regularly.\n\nLord Heywood of Whitehall, lately the UK’s Cabinet Secretary and Head of the Civil Service, championed InCiSE from the outset and continued to support the project following its launch in 2017, Lord Heywood died in November 2018 and we would like to pay tribute to his selfless commitment to public service, as well as his passion for learning and excellence, We dedicate this 2019 report to him.",

    "text": "Why and how InCiSE has been developed\nThe International Civil Service Effectiveness (InCiSE) Index was launched as a pilot in2017. Recognising the important role civil services can play in helping their countries to prosper, InCiSE aims to assess how effectively civil services around the world perform and to identify in which areas their strengths lie relative to their international counterparts.\nPrevious initiatives have sought to develop reliable civil service effectiveness measurement tools, but no other comprehensive set of indicators currently exists. There are, however, many existing data surveys and indices available globally that can be integrated to provide a single snapshot of information on a regular basis. This is what InCiSE aims to do.\nInCiSE is focused only on the central government civil service. As a result, it does not seek to measure service delivery outcomes, for example health care and education. This is because effectiveness in these areas is often driven by other parts of the public sector as well.\nInCiSE aspires progressively to become a comprehensive, comparative measure of civil service performance but is not that yet – mainly because of data limitations. In addition, InCiSE does not seek to be definitive: it will be important to assess its results alongside other evidence available to leaders and citizens. The InCiSE Index should be seen as one of a range of tools available to measure civil service effectiveness globally.\nIt is envisaged that InCiSE will have the following uses:",

Effectiveness is then assessed based on two interrelated components:\n\nCore functions – the key things a civil service does (“what”). There are 11 core function indicators.\nAttributes – the main characteristics of a civil service that can drive what they do(“how”). There are 6 attribute indicators.\n\nIt has not been possible so far to measure all indicators, largely because of data gaps. The total number of indicators measured has remained static for the 2019 report – 8 core functions (although one of these has changed) and 4 attributes.",

The methodology and approach have been enhanced, while the volume of metrics has increased, and many have been strengthened too. The range of data sources has increased significantly as well, while country coverage has been expanded from 31 to 38 countries.\nAlthough one core function, procurement, has been added to the 2019 framework, the social security administration indicator has not been included this time because of data reliability issues.\nThe 2019 framework uses the most recently available data as at 30 November 2018. Data quality inevitably varies from country to country. Only one country has data covering the full set of expanded metrics but many have close to the full set. Any missing data has been estimated using standard methods. Countries with the highest number of missing data points inevitably have the larger proportion of estimated metrics and this should be borne in mind when interpreting results.",

No single country appears in the top 5 positions for every indicator, although there are some strong all-round performers. These are highlighted in the country summary pages of this report. Standout country scores for specific indicators have been highlighted as well.\nWhen analysing results it is important to remember that all country scores are relative to others included in the Index and are not an absolute measure. A country which scores well against a particular indicator or metric may still have performance issues.\nIt is also important to note that it is not possible to directly compare scores between the 2017 and 2019 results. While this is partly because of methodology changes between the two indexes, it is also because each set of results relates to the specific data range and country set used for each Index.\nSome interesting trends can be observed in the 2019 report. As also found by the pilot edition of InCiSE, the four Commonwealth countries in the Index (Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the UK) rank in the top 5. The Nordic countries (Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden) are also placed highly, with all but Iceland in the top 10. The remaining countries of northern and western Europe tend to rank more highly than countries in southern and eastern Europe. Countries from outside Europe are distributed throughout the ranking.",

The founding institutions are reviewing the future potential of the Index and how it could be funded, as well as broader collaboration opportunities with potential new partners.\nAn International Advisory Panel has been formed which is providing strategic advice and support to the project. The goal now is to produce the InCiSE Index on a regular basis – and to increase country coverage more rapidly than first envisaged without compromising on data quality.\nSubject to funding, priority tasks over the next two years will include: further expansion of the country coverage; developing InCiSE as a practical learning and development tool, including by enhancing the interactive website; continuing to strengthen data collection and fill gaps; refining the InCiSE framework and methodology; and targeted outreach work to increase global awareness of InCiSE.\nThe pilot edition of the Index stimulated wide-ranging discussions at both country and global levels about civil service effectiveness issues. InCiSE was welcomed not only by countries which featured in the Index but also by many who did not. Some of the non-listed countries remain keen to be involved in the project so that they can learn from others and take part in broader discussions on civil service performance issues. The InCiSE team will continue to explore ways of achieving this, for example through the delivery of learning workshops in overseas locations and alongside other relevant public events.\nThe project will also continue to explore ways of including non-OECD and developing countries in the Index over time. To this end one of the InCiSE founders, the Blavatnik School of Government, has already completed two country case studies – focusing on Brazil and Nigeria – to assess the potential for InCiSE to be used in countries at different stages of economic development and with diverse political structures and traditions. These studies have provided valuable insights and ideas about what would be required to extend the Index to a wider set of countries.\nProducing a comprehensive and robust set of comparative civil service performance indicators remains a work in progress. The InCiSE team will continue to coordinate with others who are engaged in similar efforts to assess civil service effectiveness. Feedback from a wide range of interested partners is crucial to help improve the Index as well.",

    "text": "1.1 Why we need civil service effectiveness indicators\nIt is widely recognised that an effective civil service can play an important role in determining a country’s progress and prosperity. But what constitutes an “effective civil service”? This has long been the subject of debate. Even when a consensus is reached on definitions, how do civil service leaders know whether their organisations are effective – and how do they know in which areas are they performing more strongly than others? The InCiSE Index seeks to answer these questions.\nAs discussed in the 2017 report, a comprehensive set of international indicators of civil service effectiveness does not currently exist but various organisations have sought to develop reliable measurement systems, often focused on specific areas. This subject area is also well recognised in academic, international and practitioner communities as a highly complex area for analysis. This is partly because of data limitations, different views on the definitions of “civil service” and “effectiveness”, and the need to take account of country context factors when looking at performance issues.\nNevertheless, there are many existing data collections and indices available globally that can be pulled together to provide a realistic set of information on a regular basis. This is what the InCiSE framework aims to do.\nExperience and feedback so far have confirmed that the InCiSE Index and indicators have the following uses:\nThe InCiSE indicators also have the potential to help countries measure and report on progress towards achievement of international standards, for example some aspects of the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goal 16. This Goal focuses on a range of governance issues, including promoting stronger government institutions, and all UN members are required to report on progress on a regular basis.\nThe InCiSE project continues to be a collaboration between the Blavatnik School of Government and the Institute for Government. It is supported by the UK Civil Service and has been funded by theOpen Society Foundations. All have a strong interest in civil service effectiveness issues.",

    "text": "1.2 How InCiSE has been further developed\nThe InCiSE framework covers many aspects of civil service performance that earlier initiatives of this type have sought to cover but it does not duplicate them. InCiSE also aims to define “effectiveness” more extensively than previously. It draws on a wide range of existing international data sources and brings together a set of indicators – each measuring a different dimension of civil service effectiveness – to produce an overall score for each country.\nWhilst there are alternative ways to define civil service effectiveness, the InCiSE framework, with its various themes and measurements, has the potential to make valid judgments about whether a country’s civil service is performing well relative to its international counterparts.\nInCiSE was originally developed following a literature review and in consultation with many experts, including academics from schools of government, think tanks, senior civil servants (past and present) from several countries, as well as subject experts. The 2017 Pilot was also the subject of an independent, international peer review process.\nSince 2017 the project has consulted with a wide range of actors to refine the methodology and approach, strengthen the indicator metrics, increase the range of data sources and explore ways of expanding the country coverage without risking data quality. An independent peer review of the 2017 Pilot results was conducted ahead of their publication and academic engagement has continued during the development of the 2019 edition. In addition, two in-depth country case studies have been completed to assess whether and how InCiSE can be applied to contexts where obtaining good quality, reliable data remains a key challenge.\nThe accompanying Technical Report outlines in more detail how the methodology for the 2019 edition of InCiSE has developed since the Pilot.",

    "text": "1.3 What InCiSE is not aiming to do\nIt is important to reiterate the scope of InCiSE:\n\nInCiSE is focused on the central government civil service in the countries covered – not the public service more generally. It is recognised that this is not without challenges, particularly given the varying sizes and shapes of public administrations internationally, as well as different systems of government. It is also recognised that well performing civil servants are a necessary – but not sufficient – condition for better government.\nInCiSE is not seeking to measure service delivery outcomes for citizens, for example in areas like health care and education. Although in many countries the central government civil service plays an important role in determining the performance of key public services, their effectiveness is driven by other parts of the sector as well – for example, teachers, doctors and the police. Local government effectiveness is also excluded from the InCiSE framework.\nInCiSE does not aim to be definitive. It is one of a wide range of tools currently available to measure civil service effectiveness globally. Users should consider the results of the InCiSE Index alongside an analysis of the original source data as well as domestic analysis and management information, which may or may not have international comparisons.",

However, there are certain core functions they all deliver for the governments and citizens that they serve. The approach InCiSE takes is to focus on three interrelated types of core ‘functions’ to measure civil service effectiveness more comprehensively:\nBy looking across all three types of function, InCiSE aims to measure how well civil services deliver the core parts of what they do.\nEvery civil service also has an underlying set of behavioural characteristics or traits which are important drivers of how effectively core functions are delivered, for example levels of openness, integrity and inclusiveness. These attributes should apply to all parts of the civil service and should not be limited to specific core functions.\nCultivating and displaying these attributes is commonly (though not necessarily universally) understood to be good practice. They are also key determinants of an organisation’s overall effectiveness.\nThere are some concepts which could be considered attributes but which are particularly relevant to some core functions.\nFor example, the pursuit of value for money (VFM) is a key feature of the procurement function, while the use of evidence plays an important role in effective policy making. Where feasible, these concepts have been captured through the core functions of the InCiSE framework instead.\nA brief definition of each of the InCiSE indicators can be found at Annex A of this report, alongside a summary of any revisions made to each indicator since the 2017 Pilot. Further details about the InCiSE framework, can be found in the accompanying InCiSE Technical Report. A visual summary of the InCiSE framework and its context is displayed in Figure 2.1, below.",

    "text": "2.2 Data availability, limitations and revisions\nInCiSE 2019 uses the most recently available data as at 30 November 2018. Some InCiSE metrics are collected annually, some are biennial or longer, while others are ad-hoc in their repetition. As a result, while InCiSE uses the most recently available data, some metrics may use data that does not accurately reflect the current situation.\nSome measures that contribute to one of the InCiSE indicators may be relevant to other indicators as well, although this has been avoided wherever possible. No original piece of data utilised by the InCiSE model is used more than once, to ensure the overall figures are not overly reliant on a specific data source.\nMost, but not all, of the indicators in the InCiSE framework have been measured to produce the 2019 Index. In the 2017 edition, eight out of the eleven core functions proposed were measured. An additional core function has been measured for the 2019 Index – procurement. However, the social security administration indicator has not been measured this time, mainly because of feedback during the pilot phase about data reliability; alternative data sources are still to be identified. For the attributes, four out of the six have been measured, as in 2017. The functions and attributes measured in the 2019 edition of the Index are illustrated in Figure 2.1.\nThe development of the Index has continued to involve stages where subjective judgements have had to be made, for example when aggregating the results and dealing with gaps in data. The impact of these judgements on the results is explored in the Technical Report.",

    "text": "2.3 Comparisons with the 2017 Pilot edition of InCiSE\nIt is important to note that it is not possible to directly compare scores between the 2017 and 2019 editions of the Index. The InCiSE project aims to develop an Index that in due course can be compared over time. However, the Index remains in its infancy and a number of methodological differences mean that any comparison between the first two editions is not feasible. For example, in the 2019 edition the number of metrics has increased substantially, a new indicator for procurement has been included, and country coverage has expanded as well. It is hoped that, as the methodology stabilises, capacity can be built in to compare results over time. A more detailed discussion of this issue can be found in the Technical Report.\nData collection plans by other organisations may help to fill some of the remaining gaps in future. In other areas additional data collection may need to be initiated to measure the relevant indicator. The project will seek to close these data coverage gaps as InCiSE evolves.",

This continues to vary considerably from country to country and across regions. The 2017 Index covered 31 countries – all OECD members – and the data availability threshold for their inclusion was set at 75%. At the time it was judged that expanding the range of countries too quickly would require a large amount of data estimation, a reduction in the scope of the framework, or greater reliance on civil service proxy indicators, all of which could undermine the results.\nFollowing a review of the pilot phase, the 2019 Index has been expanded to cover 38countries. This has been achieved principally by developing a more nuanced way to consider the variation of data availability and quality to determine which countries should be included. The 7 new countries are: Bulgaria, Croatia, Iceland, Israel, Latvia, Lithuania and Romania. All 31 countries in the 2017 Index have been included in the 2019 version.\nFurther details about the new country coverage assessment method, as well as all data quality scores, can be found in the Technical Report.",

The policy making scores for all countries in the top 5 are very close. The UK’s and Canada’s scores are highest out of the top 5 on the quality of policy advice theme, while Finland’s and Denmark’s scores are highest on strategic planning. There is greater variation between these countries for the policy monitoring theme, with Denmark and Canada scoring highest for 2 out of the 3 metrics.

The top 2 country scores are very close, with the Republic of Korea edging ahead because of its very high scores for the transparency of public spending and budget practices themes. Germany has the highest score out of the top 5 for the effectiveness of public spending theme. New Zealand comes top for the metric looking at the openness of the budgeting process.

New Zealand achieves the maximum score for 2 metrics: the use of impact assessments in regulatory work; and the quality of impact assessments. As in 2017, Mexico’s strong performance may reflect the country’s long-standing focus on regulatory policy reforms.

This indicator has been significantly restructured to take account of feedback following the pilot report. There are now 13 metrics (an increase of 4 since 2017) and 2 data sources (one more than in 2017): the UN Hyogo Framework for Action monitoring reports; and the OECD’s Survey on the Governance of Critical Risk. The top 3 country scores for this indicator are all very close while the other 2 countries are not far behind. Scores for the metrics in this indicator are close for many countries, which is largely because of the nature of the source data. This also means that for some metrics a large number of countries score highly. Conversely, for a few metrics only a small number of countries score well.

The indicator scores for the first 4 countries are all very close, although specific metrics scores vary widely. Canada only just surpasses Ireland for the top position. This is mainly because of its relatively higher score for the metric which assesses the extent to which separate HR management practices are in place for senior civil servants. The Republic of Korea’s score is the highest out of the top 5 countries for the metric which assesses the extent to which databases are used for HR management. Of this group, Japan achieves the top score for the extent to which performance assessments are used in HR decision making.",

    "section": "",
    "text": "This chapter provides an interactive summary of each country’s results from the 2019 edition of the InCiSE Index. For the selected country, the bar chart shows the country’s score for the overall InCiSE Index (in blue) compared to the InCiSE average (in orange) and that of all other countries. The ‘radar chart’ highlights the selected country’s scores for each of the 12 indicators (in blue) compared with the InCiSE average (in orange), this chart highlights where a country performs particularly well compared to the average and where further analysis or attention may be beneficial.\nAs discussed at the start of Chapter 3, all scores in the InCiSE results are relative, meaning that the highest scoring country is assigned 1.0 and the lowest scoring country is assigned 0.0. Assessment of a country is therefore relative to others included in the Index only, and not an absolute measure.\nWeaker scores do not reflect a view on prioritisation within a country, but instead can highlight opportunities to learn from other countries.\nAppendix C provides tables of the country scores for each indicator. More detailed results of country scores, including for the metrics which underlie each indicator result, can be found on the InCiSE website. Further details about the methodological approach, including the construction of each indicator, can be found in the Technical Report.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey to reading country graphs\n\n\n\n\n\nEach country section includes a figure with two charts: a bar chart on the left hand side showing the results of the InCiSE Index and a radar chart on the right hand side showing the results of the 12 indicators that make up the Index.\nThe bar chart on the left hand side of the figure shows the country’s overall score and ranking in the InCiSE Index. The country’s score is coloured in blue, the InCiSE average is coloured in orange, all other country scores are coloured in grey.\nThe radar chart on the right hand side of the figure shows the country’s scores for each of the 12 indicators. The centre of the radar indicates a score of 0 and the outer edge indicates a score of 1, so the further out a data point is from the centre the higher the country’s score. The country’s scores are coloured in blue, a point with a white centre is used to indicate where the data for that indicator has completely missing data and their result for that indicator is fully estimated using statistical imputation.

    "text": "Expanding country coverage\nInCiSE will continue to explore ways of expanding the Index’s current country coverage, especially the potential to include non-OECD and developing countries. During 2018 the partners commissioned assessments of how the InCiSE Index could be applied in Brazil and Nigeria1. These two countries were chosen as large, regionally significant states at different stages of economic development and with diverse political structures and traditions.\n1 These can be accessed from the main Blavatnik School of Government website.The studies yielded important questions to consider as the project moves forward, such as: how well does the Index cope with countries with more distributed power and less influential executive branches of government? Are public service outcomes more important proxies for civil service effectiveness in developing countries? Does the Index assume a particular model of government, and if so, how does it capture the characteristics of systems that do not fit this model? In addition, the studies highlighted the possibility of considering the development of regional InCiSE indices, where there are data sets that cover particular regions only.\nDeveloping InCiSE as a practical learning and development tool InCiSE has major potential as a learning and development tool. Even in its pilot form InCiSE data has already been used by some governments for this purpose and there is much interest in how it could be further developed.\nThe InCiSE Index appears to be of most use for the top leadership of the civil service, senior officials tasked with driving systemic and behavioural reforms, and relevant training and research institutes. Officials with more specific responsibilities require data that speaks more directly to their functions and interests. To help make InCiSE data more accessible and relevant for users, it needs to be tailored more closely than has been possible to date. Experience so far also suggests that users want to be able to dig more deeply into what is driving the results, and then use this analysis to support learning discussions. More broadly, experience suggests that data-based approaches will only work when combined with other insights into country specific problems and solutions.\nThe project will therefore focus on two inter-related sets of activity:\n\nMaking InCiSE data more “customisable” for users, to allow them to dig deeper into country results and make more meaningful comparisons with others. This will be achieved by improving the interactivity of Index data on the Blavatnik School of Government website to enable users to tailor it for their needs, including generating reports. Over time, the goal is to establish a self-standing website;\nEnabling users to have easy access to InCiSE data experts who can help them deal with initial questions and guide early discussions on performance improvements. This will be achieved initially through the delivery of facilitated workshops in target countries and regions, ideally using local suppliers. Where feasible, these workshops could be held at the same time and location as major international public administration events.\n\n\n\nContinuing to strengthen data collection\nTasks will include: determining how best to collect data on the omitted indicators (staff engagement, innovation, IT, social security administration and finance); exploring how data collection for existing indicators can be further strengthened, including filling thematic gaps; reviewing the balance between quantitative and qualitative indicators; further expanding data sources; reducing instances of public sector performance being used as a proxy for civil service performance; and minimising cross-country applicability issues.\n\n\nRefining the InCiSE framework\nFramework tasks will include ensuring each indicator in the framework is a unique concept, to avoid duplication or overlap between the themes being measured. There is still a need to consider whether the InCiSE framework is sufficiently able to measure and compare core functions within federal government systems where some aspects could be the constitutional responsibilities of sub-national entities (e.g. a state or provincial government).\nChanges to the InCiSE framework will be determined mainly through user feedback and discussions with data owners to learn lessons from their own experiences. The International Advisory Panel will also be consulted.",

It should also continue to stimulate wide-ranging discussions at country level and globally about civil service effectiveness issues.\nProducing a comprehensive and robust set of comparative civil service performance indicators remains a work in progress. The InCiSE project team will continue to coordinate with others who are engaged in similar efforts to assess civil service effectiveness. The team will also continue to collaborate with the many organisations who have made a vital contribution to InCiSE so far by permitting the use of their research or survey data, as well as encourage further data collection in areas where it is lacking. Continued collaboration is essential to help strengthen InCiSE.\nFeedback remains vitally important to help improve the Index. The project team would welcome feedback from country governments, policy and learning networks, think tanks and academia.",

The Nordic countries (Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden) also rank highly, with all but Iceland in the top 10. The remaining countries of northern and western Europe tend to rank more highly than countries in southern and eastern Europe. Countries from outside Europe are distributed throughout the ranking.\nThe top 5 scores across some core function indicators vary significantly, making the rankings more noteworthy, while all the attribute scores are generally closer. Where there is a greater variation in scores, rankings are more significant in terms of helping countries to learn from each other. The attribute rankings show some clear country patterns emerging, with Canada and Denmark appearing in three out of the four tables. Scandinavian countries generally perform well against three of the attributes – openness, integrity and capabilities. New Zealand’s top score for the integrity attribute stands out from the rest of the table.",

The country’s score is coloured in blue, the InCiSE average is coloured in orange, all other country scores are coloured in grey.\nThe radar chart on the right hand side of the figure shows the country’s scores for each of the 12 indicators. The centre of the radar indicates a score of 0 and the outer edge indicates a score of 1, so the further out a data point is from the centre the higher the country’s score. The country’s scores are coloured in blue, a point with a white centre is used to indicate where the data for that indicator has completely missing data and their result for that indicator is fully estimated using statistical imputation. The InCiSE average for each indicator is shown in orange.",
