## Welcome {.unnumbered}

This is an HTML version of the International Civil Service Effectiveness
(InCiSE) Index 2019 Results Report,
[originally published](https://www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/news/new-index-ranks-uk-civil-service-top-followed-new-zealand-and-canada)
in April 2019 by the InCiSE Partners.

This report summarises the results of the 2019 InCiSE Index, for the index
overall, its constituent indicators and summaries of country performance. For
details on the methodology behind the InCiSE Index please see the
[Technical Report](https://incise-project.github.io/incise2019-techreport/).

From 2016 to 2019, the
[International Civil Service Effectiveness (InCiSE) project](https://www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/incise)
was a collaboration between the
[Blavatnik School of Government](https://www.bsg.ox.ac.uk) and the
[Institute for Government](http://instituteforgovernment.org.uk).
It was supported by the UK Civil Service (through the
[Cabinet Office](https://www.gov.uk/cabinetoffice)) and funded by the
[Open Society Foundations](https://www.opensocietyfoundations.org).

The Blavatnik School of Government is re-establishing the InCiSE project with
the aim of publishing a new edition of the InCiSE Index in 2024. To support
engagement with stakeholders the School is re-publishing the 2019 project
outputs (this Results Report, the
[Technical Report](https://incise-project.github.io/incise2019-techreport/)
and interactive data visualisations) in more modern and user friendly formats.

### Differences from the original 2019 publication

Some typographic errors have been corrected as part of the re-publication of
this report. There have also been some changes to the tables and figures when
compared to the original report, these are largely for layout purposes.
Footnotes have been added to charts, tables and chapters to indicate changes
in content and differences in numbering.

Please note that @sec-country-profiles of this web book provides an
interactive version of the report content - non-interactive versions of the
country profiles are available ...
