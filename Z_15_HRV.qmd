# Croatia {#sec-country-hrv .unnumbered}

:::{.lead}
Croatia is a new addition to the Index and is ranked 35th overall.
:::

```{r, country-chart}
country_plot <- country_summary(incise2019_long, "HRV", c("CAP"))
render_svg(
  country_plot, width = 700, height = 600,
  alt_text = "Summary chart of Croatia's scores in the 2019 InCiSE index."
)
```

Croatia's strongest performance is for tax administration with an overall
score just above the Index average. All metric scores for this indicator are
above average as well. Croatia achieves very high scores for metrics measuring
the extent and quality of digital service provision within the tax
administration system. It also does well on the metric assessing total tax debt
as a proportion of net revenue.

Croatia has above average scores for some metrics within the HR management
indicator, for example the extent to which formal examinations are used for
recruitment.

Whilst Croatia's scores for integrity vary, it achieves high scores for the
whistle-blower protection metric, as well as the existence of a post-employment
cooling-off period for civil servants.

The main indicators where Croatia performs less well relative to other
countries are digital services, policy making and openness.
