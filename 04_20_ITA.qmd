# Italy {#sec-country-ita .unnumbered}

:::{.lead}
Italy is ranked 25th overall on the Index and its highest score is for
procurement (ranked 6th).
:::

```{r, country-chart}
country_plot <- country_summary(incise2019_long, "AUS", c("CAP", "DIG"))
render_svg(
  country_plot, width = 700, height = 600,
  alt_text = "Summary chart of Australia's scores in the 2019 InCiSE index."
)
```

Within the procurement indicator Italy achieves the maximum score for two
metrics, namely the scale of e-procurement systems and the extent to which
policies are in place to enable small and medium-sized enterprises to take
part in central government procurement.

Italy achieves above average scores for regulation (ranked 12th), digital
services, inclusiveness and crisis and risk management. Within the regulation
indicator Italy's scores are highest for the evaluation metrics. Italy's
digital services metric scores vary but are especially high for the
availability and usability of online services for regular business operations.
Scores for crisis and risk management are mostly very high, with some at the
maximum level.

The main indicators where Italy's performance is less strong relative to other
countries are integrity, capabilities and fiscal and financial management.
Overall scores are below average, while metric scores vary widely. Within the
capabilities indicator there are however some good metric scores, for example
problem solving and readiness to learn. Italy also does well on the openness of
budgeting processes metric within the fiscal and financial management indicator.
