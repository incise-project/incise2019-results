score for fiscal and financial management.
:::

The Republic of Korea achieves above average scores for all core functions and
appears in the top 5 country rankings for half of these indicators. It achieves
the top position for fiscal and financial management mainly because of very
high scores for the transparency of public spending and budget practices themes.

The Republic of Korea is ranked 3rd for HR management and regulation, then 4th
for procurement. Within the HR management indicator, all but one of the metric
scores are well above average and these results suggest a relatively
meritocratic recruitment system overall. The Republic of Korea achieves the
maximum score for the metric on the use of databases for HR management.

On regulation, the Republic of Korea's metric scores are consistently above
average, while for procurement a high score for the e-procurement related
metric is noteworthy.

The main attribute where scores are relatively low is inclusiveness.
