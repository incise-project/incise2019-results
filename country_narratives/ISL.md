Iceland is a newcomer to the Index and is ranked 31st overall.
:::

Iceland's strongest score is for tax administration (ranked 11th) and all
metric scores are above average. It achieves only just below the maximum score
for the metric assessing the volume of online VAT returns. Iceland's score for
the efficiency metric on total tax debt as a proportion of net revenue is
strong as well.

Iceland also performs well on digital services(ranked 13th overall). Whilst
thematic scores vary, Iceland does well on most small claims services related
metrics, as well as the availability of user friendly online services for
finding a new job.

The main indicators where Iceland's scores are relatively weak are fiscal and
financial management, HR management and openness.
