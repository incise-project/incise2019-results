Switzerland is ranked 13th overall on the Index. Its strongest scores are for
crisis and risk management and integrity (both ranked 6th).
:::

Switzerland's crisis and risk management scores are all very high apart from
one metric which measures specific aspects of risk planning. This suggests a
relatively high performing core function across the board.

Within the integrity indicator, Switzerland achieves consistently high scores
for the corruption perceptions, fairness and impartiality themes. It also
achieves the maximum score for the existence of a post-employment cooling-off
period for civil servants. The whistle-blowing metrics merit further analysis
as scores vary in this area.

Switzerland is ranked 8th for fiscal and financial management, scoring highly
on performance budgeting and the effectiveness of public spending.

The main areas where Switzerland's performance is relatively less strong are
digital services, where metric scores vary, and inclusiveness.
