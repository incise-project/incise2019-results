Norway is ranked 7th overall on the Index. It achieves the top position for
openness.
:::

Norway's scores are above average for all indicators. Other high rankings are
4th for tax administration, 5th for integrity, 6th for digital services and
8th for policy making.

Norway's top position for openness reflects a consistently strong performance
across most metrics, including maximum scores for the degree of public access
to information and government consultation with citizens on policy issues.

Norway's tax administration scores are high for all but one metric, namely the
volume ofonline personal tax returns. Its highest scores are for an efficiency
metric (total tax debt as a proportion of net revenue), and the volume of
online VAT returns.

On integrity, Norway's scores are mostly above average and include the maximum
score for the existence of post-employment cooling-off systems, plus high
scores on public perceptions of corruption in the civil service. Norway's
digital services scores are mostly above average.

The main indicator where Norway's performance is less strong relative to other
countries is procurement where metric scores vary widely.
