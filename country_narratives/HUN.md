policy making.
:::

Within the policy making indicator, there are some noteworthy metric scores.
For example, Hungary achieves the maximum score for two of the three metrics
which assess the degree of policy monitoring. It also achieves the maximum
score for ministerial policy coordination.

Hungary achieves above average scores for some procurement metrics, most
notably for transparency, plus the extent to which policies are in place to
enable small and medium-sized enterprises to participate in central government
procurement.

The main core function indicators where Hungary's performance is weak relative
to other countries are digital services and fiscal and financial management.
For digital services, all metric scores are on or below average. The main
attributes where Hungary's scores are relatively weak are inclusiveness and
openness.
