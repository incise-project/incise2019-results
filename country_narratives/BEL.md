Within the HR management indicator, Belgium achieves the maximum score for
the metric assessing the extent to which formal examinations are used for
civil service recruitment. It scores highly on another employment metric,
suggesting a relatively meritocratic recruitment system overall.

Belgium's policy making score is above average and it achieves the maximum
score for one of the two policy coordination metrics. Belgium's performance is
also above average for tax administration, including two very high metric
scores on the extent and quality of digital services.

The main indicators where Belgium's performance is less strong relative to
other countries are fiscal and financial management, regulation and
capabilities where overall scores are all below average and metric results
vary widely.
