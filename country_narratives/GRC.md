Greece is ranked 37th overall on the Index and its high inclusiveness score
stands out (ranked 2nd).
:::

Within the inclusiveness indicator, Greece achieves above average scores for
all metrics. Its scores are very high for the proportion of women working in
the public sector, including in senior government positions. These high scores,
alongside Greece's above average scores for some of the HR management metrics,
may merit further analysis.

The main indicators where Greece's performance is relatively weaker are
capabilities, regulation, tax administration and digital services. There are
however some strong metric scores within these indicators. For example,
Greece's scores are high for the capabilities metrics measuring the degree of
problem solving skills and readiness to learn. Within the tax administration
indicator, there are high scores for the metrics assessing the quality and
availability of online services for personal, VAT and corporate returns.
