Canada is ranked 3rd overall on the Index and is ranked top for HR management
and inclusiveness.
:::

Canada's top position for HR management and inclusiveness suggests that it has
many lessons to share with other countries concerning recruiting, attracting
and managing talent, as well as promoting gender and ethnic representation
issues in the civil service.

Canada is ranked 2nd for integrity. It achieves very high scores for most
attributes, appearing in the top 5 for all but the openness indicator where it
is ranked 8th. This is mainly because of relatively lower scores for the right
to information theme.

Canada's scores for policy making are very high as well (ranked 4th), most
notably for the metrics assessing the quality of policy advice and policy
monitoring. It is also ranked 4th for regulation.

The main indicator where Canada's performance is less strong compared
with other countries is crisis and risk management where its overall score is
at the InCiSE average.
