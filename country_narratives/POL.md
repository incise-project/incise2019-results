Poland is ranked 28th overall on the Index and its strongest score is for
inclusiveness (ranked 3rd).
:::

Within the inclusiveness indicator, Poland's maximum score for the metric
assessing the proportion of women in senior government positions is
significant.

Poland is ranked 8th for capabilities. Most metric scores are above average,
with the highest ones being the percentage of staff who have completed
tertiary education, plus the use of planning skills in the workplace.

Poland does well on all metrics within the core capabilities theme (literacy,
numeracy, problem solving skills), while the readiness to learn score is
strong as well.

The main areas where Poland's performance is relatively weak compared with
other countries are tax administration and procurement, as well as crisis and
risk management where metric scores vary widely.
