Ireland is ranked 14th overall on the Index. Its highest scores are for HR
management and tax administration (both ranked 2nd).
:::

Ireland only just misses out on the top position for HR management. All but
one of its metric results are well above average and it achieves the maximum
score for the metric assessing the extent to which recruitment systems are
meritocratic.

On tax administration, Ireland's scores are consistently high, most notably
the metrics assessing total tax debt as a proportion of net revenue and the
volume of online VAT and corporate tax returns.

Ireland is ranked 7th overall for procurement and it has well above average
scores for administrative effectiveness.

The main indicators where Ireland's performance is relatively low are digital
services regulation and openness where metric scores vary widely.
