Mexico is ranked 18th overall on the Index. It is ranked 2nd for the regulation
indicator.
:::

Mexico's strong regulation performance may reflect the country's long-standing
focus on policy reforms in this area, with most metric scores well above
average. It achieves the maximum score for one of the two stakeholder
engagement metrics and scores highly against the other one. In addition,
Mexico achieves very high scores for two appraisal and evaluation metrics.

Mexico is ranked 6th for fiscal and financial management and 7th for tax
administration. Mexico achieves maximum or near maximum scores for the tax
administration theme measuring the extent and quality of digital service
provision, as well as for the theme assessing the overall efficiency of
tax collection.

The main indicators where Mexico's scores are weak relative to other countries
are integrity and HR management. However, Mexico does achieve one maximum score
within the HR management indicator, namely the metric assessing the extent to
which senior staff salaries compare favourably with similar jobs in the private
sector.
