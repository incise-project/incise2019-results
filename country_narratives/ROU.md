Romania is a new addition to the Index and is ranked 36th overall.
:::

Romania's high inclusiveness score (ranked 5th) stands out from all its
other results.

Romania also does well on some tax administration metrics, for example
efficiency issues (total tax debt as a proportion of net revenue) and the
volume of online corporate and VAT returns. Romania's regulation and fiscal
and financial management scores are around the average.

The main indicators where Romania's performance is less strong relative to
other countries are policy making, digital services and procurement, although
for the latter it does well on the metric assessing e-procurement systems.
