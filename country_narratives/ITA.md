services, inclusiveness and crisis and risk management. Within the regulation
indicator Italy's scores are highest for the evaluation metrics. Italy's
digital services metric scores vary but are especially high for the

maximum level.

The main indicators where Italy's performance is less strong relative to other

problem solving and readiness to learn. Italy also does well on the openness of
