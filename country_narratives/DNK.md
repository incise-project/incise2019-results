Within the policy making indicator, Denmark achieves the maximum score for the
metrics assessing strategic planning, the extent to which academic advice
influences policy decisions, and policy monitoring issues.

On openness, Denmark performs very strongly across the theme assessing the
degree of consultation with society on policy issues, including achieving
maximum scores for two out of three metrics. Denmark achieves the maximum score
