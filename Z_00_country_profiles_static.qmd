# Country profiles of the 2019 InCiSE results (accessible version) {.unnumbered}

::: {.callout-note .crf title="Accessible version" icon="false"}
This section provides static versions of the interactive country profile
content in @sec-country-profiles - it is equivalent to the content provided
in Chapter 4 of the original 2019 PDF publication.
:::

Each page in this section  provides a visual summary of each country's results
from the 2019 edition  of the InCiSE Index. For each country, there is a bar
chart showing its position in the overall Index, as well as a ‘radar chart’
showing their scores for each indicator compared with the InCiSE average. The
radar charts highlight where a country performs particularly well compared to
the average and where further analysis or attention may be beneficial.

As discussed at the start of @sec-index-results, all scores in the InCiSE
results are relative, meaning that the highest scoring country is assigned
1.0 and the lowest scoring country is assigned 0.0. Assessment of a country is
therefore relative to others included in the Index only, and not an absolute
measure.

Weaker scores do not reflect a view on prioritisation within a country, but
instead can highlight opportunities to learn from other countries.

@sec-scores-rankings provides tables of the country score for each indicator.
More detailed results of country scores, including for the metrics which
underlie each indicator result, can be found on the InCiSE website. Further
details about the methodological approach, including the construction of each
indicator, can be found in the
[Technical Report](http://incise-project.github.io/incise2019-techreport/).

## Key to reading country graphs

Each country section includes a figure with two charts: a bar chart on the
left hand side showing the results of the InCiSE Index and a radar chart on
the right hand side showing the results of the 12 indicators that make up
the Index.

The bar chart on the left hand side of the figure shows the country's overall
score and ranking in the InCiSE Index. The country's score is coloured in teal,
the InCiSE average is coloured in dark grey, all other country scores are
coloured in light grey.

The radar chart on the right hand side of the figure shows the country's scores
for each of the 12 indicators. The centre of the radar indicates a score of 0
and the outer edge indicates a score of 1, so the further out a data point is
from the centre the higher the country's score. The country's scores are
coloured in teal, a point with a white centre is used to indicate where the
data for that indicator has completely missing data and their result for that
indicator is fully estimated using statistical imputation. The InCiSE average
for each indicator is shown in dark grey.
