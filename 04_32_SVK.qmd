# Slovakia {#sec-country-svk .unnumbered}

:::{.lead}
Slovakia is ranked 33rd overall on the Index and its strongest score is for
capabilities (ranked 10th).
:::

```{r, country-chart}
country_plot <- country_summary(incise2019_long, "AUS", c("CAP", "DIG"))
render_svg(
  country_plot, width = 700, height = 600,
  alt_text = "Summary chart of Australia's scores in the 2019 InCiSE index."
)
```

Within the capabilities indicator, Slovakia achieves the maximum score for the
metric assessing numeracy in the workplace. It also does well on the core
capabilities theme (numeracy, literacy and problem-solving skills), as well as
the readiness to learn metric.

Although Slovakia's other indicator scores are on or below average, there are
some strong metric scores which suggest good practices in key areas. For
example, on procurement Slovakia achieves the maximum score for administrative
effectiveness and scores very highly on transparency. On fiscal and financial
management, Slovakia does well on the extent of published finance data, while
for HR management it scores well on the use of performance related pay. On tax
administration, Slovakia scores highly on the volume of online VAT returns.

The main areas where Slovakia's performance is weak relative to other
countries are HR management, integrity and policy making.
