# United Kingdom {#sec-country-gbr .unnumbered}

:::{.lead}
The UK tops the InCiSE Index overall. It is in the top position for regulation.

```{r, country-chart}
country_plot <- country_summary(incise2019_long, "GBR")
render_svg(
  country_plot, width = 700, height = 600,
  alt_text = "Summary chart of United Kingdom's scores in the 2019 InCiSE index."
)
```

The UK performs relatively highly for most indicators and is in the top 5
country rankings for 6 core function indicators â€“ policy making (3rd), fiscal
and financial management (3rd), HR management (5th), procurement (3rd), tax
administration (3rd), and regulation. On attributes, the UK is ranked 3rd
for openness.

Within the regulation indicator, the UK achieves the maximum score for 4 out
of 9 metrics and all scores are well above average. On fiscal and financial
management, the UK achieves high scores for performance budgeting. Within the
procurement indicator, it achieves the maximum score for the extent to which
policies are in place to help small and medium-sized enterprises participate
in central government procurement.

The only indicator below average is digital services where metric scores vary
widely. The UK's integrity scores vary as well. It does well on the corruption
perception theme but less so on the thematic scores for processes to preserve
integrity and prevent conflicts of interest. The UK's inclusiveness score is
less strong relative to other countries, most notably on the metric assessing
the proportion of women in senior roles in central government.
