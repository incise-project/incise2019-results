for crisis and risk management.

```{r, country-chart}
country_plot <- country_summary(incise2019_long, "NLD")
render_svg(
  country_plot, width = 700, height = 600,
  alt_text = "Summary chart of Netherlands's scores in the 2019 InCiSE index."
)
```

The Netherlands achieves above average scores for all but one indicator. It is
ranked 5th for openness and tax administration, and 7th for digital services.

Within the crisis and risk management indicator the Netherlands achieves the
maximum score for 10 out of the 13 metrics. This suggests it has positive
lessons to share with other countries who wish to improve in this area.

On tax administration, theNetherlands achieves very high scores forall but one
metric. For digital services, it does well on all metrics. This includes
maximum scores for the metrics assessing online services for businesses and
the use of technological advances to improve online employment services.

The Netherlands' strong performance on openness includes very high scores for
the theme assessing public consultation on key issues, plus a maximum score for
the complaints mechanism metric.

The main indicator where the Netherlands' performance is relatively less strong
is policy making where scores are mostly on or below average, apart from the
strategic planning metric.
