# Slovenia {#sec-country-svn .unnumbered}

:::{.lead}
Slovenia is ranked 26th overall on the Index and its strongest score is for
inclusiveness (ranked 7th).
:::

```{r, country-chart}
country_plot <- country_summary(incise2019_long, "SVN")
render_svg(
  country_plot, width = 700, height = 600,
  alt_text = "Summary chart of Slovenia's scores in the 2019 InCiSE index."
)
```

Within the inclusiveness indicator, Slovenia achieves the maximum metric
scores for the degree of ethnic minority representation and women in senior
management posts.

Slovenia is ranked 9th for crisis and risk management. All metric scores are
very high or above average. Slovakia's HR management, capabilities and fiscal
and financial management scores are all above average. Within these and other
indicators there are some notable metric scores, for example the use of
performance related pay and databases in HR management and, within
capabilities, learning at work.

Although Slovenia's tax administration score is just below average, it
achieves the maximum scores for the volume of online VAT and corporate tax
returns. On integrity, it achieves the maximum score for the degree of
whistle-blower protection.

The main areas where Slovenia's performance is weak relative to other
countries and where metric scores vary are policy making, procurement and
digital services.
