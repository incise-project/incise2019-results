# Turkey {#sec-country-tur .unnumbered}

:::{.lead}
Turkey is ranked 32nd overall on the Index and its strongest score is for
inclusiveness.
:::

```{r, country-chart}
country_plot <- country_summary(incise2019_long, "TUR")
render_svg(
  country_plot, width = 700, height = 600,
  alt_text = "Summary chart of Turkey's scores in the 2019 InCiSE index."
)
```

Within the inclusiveness indicator, Turkey achieves the maximum score for the
proportion of women working in the public sector.

Turkey's crisis and risk management indicator score is above average. It
achieves the maximum score for half of all metrics including aspects of risk
planning, monitoring, preparedness, the existence and use of early warning
systems, and international cooperation processes.

Turkey's scores for tax administration and fiscal and financial management
are also above average. On the latter it does well on medium-term budgeting
and the degree to which financial information is published.

The main areas where Turkey's performance is low relative to other countries
are regulation, capabilities and openness.
