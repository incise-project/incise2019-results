# New Zealand {#sec-country-nzl .unnumbered}

:::{.lead}
New Zealand is ranked 2nd overall on the Index. It is ranked top for integrity,
capabilities and procurement.

```{r, country-chart}
country_plot <- country_summary(incise2019_long, "AUS", c("CAP", "DIG"))
render_svg(
  country_plot, width = 700, height = 600,
  alt_text = "Summary chart of Australia's scores in the 2019 InCiSE index."
)
```

New Zealand's integrity score is well ahead of other leading countries in the
Index and it achieves the maximum score for almost half of the metrics within
this indicator.

New Zealand's top position for procurement is primarily because of its maximum
scores for three metrics: the extent of e-procurement functions within
government procurement systems; the role of the central purchasing body; and
the extent to which policies are in place to enable small and medium-sized
enterprises to take part in central government procurement. This suggests that
New Zealand has positive lessons to share with other countries who wish to
improve in these areas.

New Zealand's capabilities ranking reflects very strong scores for many of the
metrics. This includes achieving maximum scores for the metrics assessing the
extent of IT and influencing skills in the workplace. Scores for the job
related learning metric are very strong as well.

Tax administration is the main indicator where New Zealand's performance is
less strong relative to other countries.
