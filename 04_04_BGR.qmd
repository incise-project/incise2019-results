country_plot <- country_summary(incise2019_long, "AUS", c("CAP", "DIG"))

for risk planning, the degree of international cooperation, and the existence
and use of early warning systems. Most metric scores for this indicator are
above average.

Within the capabilities indicator, Bulgaria achieves good scores for the

readiness to learn. It also scores well against the open budget metric within
the fiscal and financial management indicator.
