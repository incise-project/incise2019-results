# The InCiSE framework and approach {#sec-incise-framework}

This chapter sets out the approach taken to further develop the InCiSE
framework and produce the Index, as well as country coverage issues. It also
explains how the InCiSE framework has evolved and expanded since the 2017
Pilot.

A detailed explanation of the choice of indicators, their definitions, data
availability and quality issues, can be found in the Technical Report.

## Defining the InCiSE framework {#sec-defining-framework}

The InCiSE framework starts by defining the core characteristics of an
effective central government civil service. To do this, it assesses
effectiveness based on two interrelated components:

* Functions: the core things that civil services deliver in each
  country (‘what’).
* Attributes: the characteristics or behaviours across every part of a
  civil service which are important drivers of the way core functions are
  delivered (‘how’).

Civil services across the world vary widely in their shape, size, and
responsibilities. However, there are certain core functions they all deliver
for the governments and citizens that they serve. The approach InCiSE takes is
to focus on three interrelated types of core ‘functions’ to measure civil
service effectiveness more comprehensively:

* Central executive functions for ministers, the effects of which are felt by
  citizens (e.g. policy making, fiscal management, regulation, crisis/risk
  management).
* Service delivery functions where central government civil services interact
  more directly with citizens (e.g. tax and social security administration,
  digital services).
* ‘Mission support’ functions which enable a civil service to do its job (e.g.
  finance, human resource management, IT, procurement).

By looking across all three types of function, InCiSE aims to measure how well
civil services deliver the core parts of what they do.

Every civil service also has an underlying set of behavioural characteristics
or traits which are important drivers of how effectively core functions are
delivered, for example levels of openness, integrity and inclusiveness.
These attributes should apply to all parts of the civil service and should not
be limited to specific core functions.

Cultivating and displaying these attributes is commonly (though not necessarily
universally) understood to be good practice. They are also key determinants of
an organisation’s overall effectiveness.

There are some concepts which could be considered attributes but which are
particularly relevant to some core functions.

For example, the pursuit of value for money (VFM) is a key feature of the
procurement function, while the use of evidence plays an important role in
effective policy making. Where feasible, these concepts have been captured
through the core functions of the InCiSE framework instead.

A brief definition of each of the InCiSE indicators can be found at Annex A of
this report, alongside a summary of any revisions made to each indicator since
the 2017 Pilot. Further details about the InCiSE framework, can be found in the
accompanying InCiSE Technical Report. A visual summary of the InCiSE framework
and its context is displayed in @fig-framework, below.

## Data availability, limitations and revisions {#sec-data-availability}

InCiSE 2019 uses the most recently available data as at 30 November 2018.
Some InCiSE metrics are collected annually, some are biennial or longer, while
others are ad-hoc in their repetition. As a result, while InCiSE uses the most
recently available data, some metrics may use data that does not accurately
reflect the current situation.

Some measures that contribute to one of the InCiSE indicators may be relevant
to other indicators as well, although this has been avoided wherever possible.
No original piece of data utilised by the InCiSE model is used more than once,
to ensure the overall figures are not overly reliant on a specific data source.

Most, but not all, of the indicators in the InCiSE framework have been measured
to produce the 2019 Index. In the 2017 edition, eight out of the eleven core
functions proposed were measured. An additional core function has been measured
for the 2019 Index – procurement. However, the social security administration
indicator has not been measured this time, mainly because of feedback during
the pilot phase about data reliability; alternative data sources are still to
be identified. For the attributes, four out of the six have been measured, as
in 2017. The functions and attributes measured in the 2019 edition of the
Index are illustrated in @fig-framework.

The development of the Index has continued to involve stages where subjective
judgements have had to be made, for example when aggregating the results and
dealing with gaps in data. The impact of these judgements on the results is
explored in the Technical Report.

## Comparisons with the 2017 Pilot edition of InCiSE {#sec-comparisons}

It is important to note that it is not possible to directly compare scores
between the 2017 and 2019 editions of the Index. The InCiSE project aims to
develop an Index that in due course can be compared over time. However, the
Index remains in its infancy and a number of methodological differences mean
that any comparison between the first two editions is not feasible. For
example, in the 2019 edition the number of metrics has increased substantially,
a new indicator for procurement has been included, and country coverage has
expanded as well. It is hoped that, as the methodology stabilises, capacity
can be built in to compare results over time. A more detailed discussion of
this issue can be found in the Technical Report.

Data collection plans by other organisations may help to fill some of the
remaining gaps in future. In other areas additional data collection may need
to be initiated to measure the relevant indicator. The project will seek to
close these data coverage gaps as InCiSE evolves.

## Data sources {#sec-data-sources}

A wealth of data underlies the 12 indicators measured so far. Each indicator
has one or more broad themes which are then assessed via a specific set of
metrics.

Most of the 76 metrics in the 2017 Pilot have continued to be used in the 2019
model. Of the 70 metrics in the 2017 Index that are directly comparable to the
2019 edition, 33 have had updates which have been incorporated in the InCiSE
model. A further 46 metrics have been incorporated, bringing the total number
of metrics to 116.

A detailed summary of the data sources used by the InCiSE Index is provided at
Annex B. Further details on how these data sources have been developed to
measure each indicator are available in the Technical Report.

## Country coverage {#sec-country-coverage}

The extent of country coverage is reliant on the availability of a wide range
of datasets and collections. This continues to vary considerably from country
to country and across regions. The 2017 Index covered 31 countries – all OECD
members – and the data availability threshold for their inclusion was set at
75%. At the time it was judged that expanding the range of countries too
quickly would require a large amount of data estimation, a reduction in the
scope of the framework, or greater reliance on civil service proxy indicators,
all of which could undermine the results.

Following a review of the pilot phase, the 2019 Index has been expanded to
cover 38countries. This has been achieved principally by developing a more
nuanced way to consider the variation of data availability and quality to
determine which countries should be included. The 7 new countries are:
Bulgaria, Croatia, Iceland, Israel, Latvia, Lithuania and Romania. All 31
countries in the 2017 Index have been included in the 2019 version.

Further details about the new country coverage assessment method, as well as
all data quality scores, can be found in the Technical Report.

## Variations in data quality by country {#sec-coverage-variations}

For most indicators, all 38 countries have generally good data quality.
However, for 4 indicators (capabilities, crisis and risk management, digital
services and procurement) a small number of countries have no available data
at all. The UK achieved the highest overall data quality score, followed
closely by five other countries – Italy, Poland, Sweden, Norway and Slovenia.

Missing data has been estimated through statistical simulation (using a method
called multiple imputation). Countries with more missing data points inevitably
have a larger proportion of estimated metrics and this factor should be borne
in mind when interpreting results. Further details about this methodology can
be found in the Technical Report.
