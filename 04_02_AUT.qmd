# Austria {#sec-country-aut .unnumbered}

:::{.lead}
Austria is ranked 16th overall on the Index. The country's strongest score is
for digital services (ranked 4th).

```{r, country-chart}
country_plot <- country_summary(incise2019_long, "AUS", c("CAP", "DIG"))
render_svg(
  country_plot, width = 700, height = 600,
  alt_text = "Summary chart of Australia's scores in the 2019 InCiSE index."
)
```

Within the digital services indicator Austria achieves the maximum score for
three metrics, including two concerning availability and access to small claims
procedures for both Austrian nationals and non-nationals.

Austria also scores strongly on tax administration (ranked 6th). Within this
indicator it scores well on the time to pay taxes, tax debt as a proportion of
net revenue and the proportion of citizens filing their corporate and VAT tax
returns online.

The main indicators where Austria's scores are relatively less strong are
policy making, HR management and capabilities, although there are some good
individual metric results within them.
