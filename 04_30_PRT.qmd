# Portugal {#sec-country-prt .unnumbered}

:::{.lead}
Portugal is ranked 29th overall on the Index. It achieves very strong scores for
digital services (ranked 5th).

```{r, country-chart}
country_plot <- country_summary(incise2019_long, "AUS", c("CAP", "DIG"))
render_svg(
  country_plot, width = 700, height = 600,
  alt_text = "Summary chart of Australia's scores in the 2019 InCiSE index."
)
```

Portugal's high digital services score stands out from all its other results.
Metric scores are above average for all but one area and it achieves the
maximum score for four of them. These include the availability and user
friendliness of online services for businesses and employment services, the
extent to which technological advances have helped to improve online business
services, and the ability of non-nationals to use online business start-up
services.

The main indicators where Portugal's scores are below average are regulation,
procurement, and crisis and risk management. However, it is notable that
within the procurement indicator Portugal achieves a high score for the metric
that assesses the degree of e-procurement functions. Scores for the metrics
within the tax administration indicator that focus on online services are
strong as well.
