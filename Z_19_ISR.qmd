```{r, country-chart}
country_plot <- country_summary(incise2019_long, "ISR", c("DIG"))

)
```

Israel's strongest performance is for procurement where it is ranked 5th
overall, although some metric scores have been estimated. It achieves the
maximum score for the extent to which policies are in place to enable small
and medium-sized enterprises to participate in central government procurement.

Israel has an above average score for HR management, scoring particularly well
on the performance management metrics, as well as on the use of data for HR
decision making.

Israel's attributes scores are all below average relative to other countries
but there are some strong individual metric scores. For example, within the
inclusiveness indicator Israel's score is high for the proportion of women in
senior management posts. Israel also does well on the learning and readiness to
learn metrics within the capabilities indicator. On integrity, Israel achieves
the maximum score for the existence of a post-employment cooling-off period.

The main indicators where Israel's relative performance is less strong are tax
administration and fiscal and financial management.
