administration and crisis and risk management.

```{r, country-chart}
country_plot <- country_summary(incise2019_long, "ESP")
render_svg(
  country_plot, width = 700, height = 600,
  alt_text = "Summary chart of Spain's scores in the 2019 InCiSE index."
)
```

Spain is ranked 8th for tax administration and all metric scores are well
above average. It achieves the maximum score for the metrics assessing the
volume of online VAT and corporate tax returns, as well as the efficiency
metric measuring total tax debt as a proportion of net revenue.

Within the crisis and risk management indicator (also ranked 8th), Spain
achieves the maximum score for two thirds of the metrics. Scores are spread
across all the main themes which suggests a consistently strong performance
across this core function.

Spain also does well on some aspects of digital services where it is ranked
10th overall. For example, metric scores are very high for the availability
and usability of various online services, as well as the use of technological
advances for business start-up services. It is notable that Spain does well on
digital related metrics within other indicators as well.

The main indicators where Spain's performance is less strong relative to other
countries are regulation and HR management.
