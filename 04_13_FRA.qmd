management (ranked 6th).

```{r, country-chart}
country_plot <- country_summary(incise2019_long, "AUS", c("CAP", "DIG"))
render_svg(
  country_plot, width = 700, height = 600,
  alt_text = "Summary chart of Australia's scores in the 2019 InCiSE index."
)
```

Within the HR management indicator, France's highest scores are for the
performance management theme. It achieves the maximum score for the existence
of separate HR management practices for the senior civil service and scores
highly on the use of performance assessments in HRdecision making. France's
score is also high for the metric on the extent to which formal examinations
are used for civil service recruitment.

France performs strongly on openness (ranked 7th), achieving high scores for
most metrics, most notably those measuring levels of e-government methods of
consultation with citizens on key issues and open data practices. France also
does well on procurement (ranked 8th) where its score for the transparency
metric is high.

The main indicators where France's performance is less strong relative to other
countries are for inclusiveness and capabilities.
